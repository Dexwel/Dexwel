### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ am Daniel Adediran

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on using the knowledge of bioinformatics to understand and answer biological questions problem especially when it comes to genetic diseases, cancer specifically.

 ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning how to use R, Python and Bash scripting. Also learning about nextflow, nf-core and docker with the aim of automating bioinformatic workflow and to achieve reproducibilty.
 
 ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking forward to collaborate in project relateds to mutational signature analysis, cancer gene identification, and every analysis that would help understand more about cancers. I am also interested in project related to Crispr and CAR-T technology and any biological data analysis and bioinformatics software development open source project.
